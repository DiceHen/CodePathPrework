## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Instagram
    * stories - uploading pictures/videos for 24 hours then are removed
    * sending posts you like to friends
    * explore page - currated content based on previously liked content
2. Books (apple books) 
    * customizable visuals- themes, font, size, page turn animations
    * library - collection of all books that you have, can sort however you want
    * reading goal - times how long you've read, how many days you've read, how many books you've read
3. Pinterest
    * Home Page- curated content based on what you have saved
    * Boards - content "pinned" like a photo album, your own or others
    * Visual Search - searches what you highlight in a picture and finds the same or similar things 

My Idea (for now)
I kind of like the idea of a mix between the books app (where you read the book) and goodreads (a book review platform). Maybe something that a book club could use (if they're digital readers) and you could form groups with friends and see their progress in the book and what notes/comments they made on the book. So it would be a basic book app like the one apple already made, but with another section where if other people you know have the book, you can form a group (public or private) and read together. It could have a main board where the comments you make are uploaded (with context like the rest of the page or paragraph). If you haven't read that part yet, the comment will be hidden with a note of where the comment it (page number) unless you choose to click and see the comment even though it could be a spoiler. There could also be a public group section where you can see if there are other groups reading your book and join with notes of how long ago the group was formed and how far in the book they are, so you can join a group best fitted towards your needs. Those are the ideas I have so far, there's probably much more that could be implemented, but thats the basic outline I have in my head as of right now. Thank you for reading! Sorry if there are any typos, I just wanted to get everything I thought of written before I jumbled up things in my head. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most difficult and time consuming aspect was getting used to the layout of XCode and figuring out where the instructions were telling you where to go.     ex. I could not find the "Adjust Editor Options" button and Assistant button
